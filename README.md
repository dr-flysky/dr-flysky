### 🧑‍💻 About Me

- 🔭Senior Software Engineer with a cross-stack background spanning C++ systems work, C#/.NET services, Python automation/AI, and modern full-stack development. I’ve delivered production systems that prioritize performance, uptime, and maintainability, including API platforms, distributed services, data workflows, and user-facing web apps.

- 📊I enjoy tackling hard problems-latency and throughput bottlenecks, complex integrations, and ambiguous requirements-and turning them into simple, testable, observable solutions. I value strong engineering fundamentals (design reviews, code quality, CI/CD, monitoring) and pragmatic delivery
